Please note that while this code is distributed under Apache License 2.0,
dependencies, especially the nvdiffrast library are not, and licensing
should be determined on a per algorithm basis. The Hydra ICP algorithm, e.g.,
vastly relies on PyTorch, SAM 2, OpenCV, Numpy, and their dependencies, 
only.
